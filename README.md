This is a very simple batch script that will help you to crack rar/7z/zip passwords.

All what you have to do is just double click the file and follow the steps.

+ Note: - You need a wordlist or dictionary of course to the process.
        - I added wordlists, but you may need better ones.
        
* The speed of this program depends on the hardware, but if you are planning to crack complex 
  passwords then this is not the appropriate tool for you.
* This program is proof of concept of simple bruteforce attack on password protected archives.
